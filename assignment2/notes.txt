planner.py has all the code, it is invoked in plannes.sh by passing all the args as is

episodic vs continuous: In continuous I am solving for S number of variables(the Value functions), in episodic
V of last node is zero, so I am solving for S-1 number of variables

when the pulp solver gives error, (in infeasible problems eg: mdp with no solutions), I am printing
"problem is infeasible!" and exiting

used the pulp solver itself for solving linear equations in policy evaluation step of policy iterartion
